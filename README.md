Pre-requisite:

1. Install Golang from https://golang.org/dl/

Steps:

2. Clone the repo and add its location to system $GOPATH
3. To execute main program which essentially contains tests ( feel free to edit ), just run *go run main.go*

PS: Inside triangle-app folder
:> triangle.go : contains the logical code to determine triangle type
:> triangle_test.go : Unit test cases to exert complete coverage to above logical code
